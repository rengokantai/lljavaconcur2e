```
public class MyThread extends Thread{
  public void run(){
  }
}
```

```
public class MyRunnable implements Runnable{
  public void run(){
  }
}

MyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();
new Thread(myRunnable).start();

There are two types of Threads in Java: User Threads and Daemon Threads.
When a JVM starts if contains a single User Thread.  
- Known as main Thread  

Use Threads and Daemon THreads differ in what happens when they exit.
- The lifecycle a User Thread can outlive the Main Thread.
- All Daemon Threads terminate automatically when all User Threads terminate

- The JVM itself exits when all User Threads have exited and any remaining Threads are all Daemon Threads.

If launched with no command-line parameters the Main Thread creates a User Thread  
If launched with a command line parameter then it creates a Daemon Thread.
